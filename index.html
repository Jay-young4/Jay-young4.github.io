   <p1>I learned from my research that Reptiles can go months without food or water and that
    most of them can even reproduce without a mate Reptiles are also not as dangerous than we believe them to be
but are just territorial creatures just like any other animals

<h2> Why I believe reptiles are better than most pets</h2>
<p2>I believe that Reptiles are better than most pets because they don't need daily attention like a normal pet and are easy to care for compare to your everyday normal pet </p2>
<h3>What people don't realize</h3>
<p3>What a lot of people don't know is that they are just misunderstood creatures looking for attention just like any other animal or person</p3>
